Just to check if my understanding is correct, I have a few questions:
<ol>
    <li>Is the data in the file "data.txt" a time series data?</li>
    <li>Is the data in the file "data.txt" a multivariate time series data?</li>
    <li>Is the data in the file "data.txt" a univariate time series data?</li>
    <li>Is the data in the file "data.txt" a non-stationary time series data?</li>
    <li>Is the data in the file "data.txt" a stationary time series data?</li>
    <li>Is the data in the file "data.txt" a time series data with a trend?</li>
    <li>Is the data in the file "data.txt" a time series data with seasonality?</li>
    <li>Is the data in the file "data.txt" a time series data with noise?</li>
    <li>Is the data in the file "data.txt" a time series data with cyclic patterns?</li>
    <li>Is the data in the file "data.txt" a time series data with a trend and seasonality?</li>
    <li>Is the data in the file "data.txt" a time series data with a trend and noise?</li>
    <li>Is the data in the file "data.txt" a time series data with a trend and cyclic patterns?</li>
    <li>Is the data in the file "data.txt" a time series data with a trend, seasonality and noise?</li>
    <li>Is the data in the file "data.txt" a time series data with a trend, seasonality and cyclic patterns?</li>
    <li>Is the data in the file "data.txt" a time series data with a trend, noise and cyclic patterns?</li>
    <li>Is the data in the file "data.txt" a time series data with a trend, seasonality, noise and cyclic patterns?</li>
    <li>What are some common methods to make a time series data stationary?</li>
    <li>How can we determine whether a time series data is stationary or not?</li>
</ol>
I am new to time series analysis so any help would be appreciated. Thanks!
